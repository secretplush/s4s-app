## Mass DM System — LIVE
- Fixed SFS Exclude list IDs for 14 models (were pointing to empty duplicates)
- Rewrote scheduling: 30 models evenly spaced at 2-min intervals per window, 12 windows/day
- No catch-up on missed windows (5-min grace only), regenerate on enable
- First window fired successfully at 12:00 PM AST, 30/30 sent
- 5 models have no SFS Exclude list: keelydavidson, caraaawesley, andreaelizabethxo, harpermccoyyy, lolaxmae

## Daily Audit System — Pilot Complete
- 3 pilot models: laceythomass, chloecookk, sadieeblake
- Pulled chats + transactions via OF API, AI-scored conversations
- Saved to `research/daily-audit-2026-02-11.json` and `research/daily-audit-2026-02-11-summary.md`
- **Kiefer feedback:** v1 scoring too dumb — flagged teaser selfies as "free nudes" missed revenue. Must distinguish clothed teasers (legit sales tactic) from actual explicit content giveaways.
- Nick on sadieeblake asked custom pricing twice, got free teasers instead of a quote (~$50-100 missed) — Kiefer wants to see actual transcript
- Need: smarter analysis using Nina playbook as benchmark, don't flag SOPs as mistakes

## OF API Accounts
- 49 accounts now connected (Kiefer added 14 new ones)
- Built sync-accounts feature to dynamically pull from API

## Next Steps
- Refine audit scoring (content type distinction, reasoning for flags)
- Build automated daily cron on Railway with Claude API scoring
- CEO view at `/audits` on S4S app, chatter view on chatter-intel app
- Remove "back to S4S" link from chatter-intel
- Fix response time calc (exclude abandoned convos >4h)
- GitHub auth still broken — deploying via `railway up`
