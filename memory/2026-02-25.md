## Chatbot Dashboard
- Deployed: https://chatbot-dashboard-three.vercel.app
- 8 sections: Model Selector, Model Info, Vault Map, Live Feed, Queue, Stats, Fan Intelligence, Exclude List
- SpendBadge on all fan-facing components (green $500+, yellow $50-500, gray <$50)
- Fan profile page at `/fan/[id]` (mock data)

## Fan Index / Bulk Export
- Killed slow per-page backfill (was using `/fans/latest` at 97 fans/page)
- Switched to OF API Pro Data Export tool (UI at `https://app.onlyfansapi.com/team/plush/tools/data-export`)
- Export supports: Fans with 24 fields, all fan types, across all 68 accounts
- Programmatic POST `/api/data-exports` returned 500 errors — must use UI
- Got to account selector dialog, need to click "Select All" and submit
- **Next:** Complete export, download results, parse into master-index.json

## Webhooks
- Global webhook `wh_3026dc57c9c245fcaedefe5e1b51b3d4` covers all 68 accounts
- Added `tips.received` event
- Plan: webhooks keep fan index current after one-time bulk backfill
