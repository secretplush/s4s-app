## ninacarlson Tracking (Ongoing)

### 🎉 1K MILESTONE HIT!
- Started: 696 fans (midnight)
- Hit 1K: ~10:45am AST
- Growth: +304 fans in ~11.5 hours (~27/hour average)

### Tracking Stats (as of ~1:30pm)
- **46 unique tags captured** (Loop 4 confirmed)
- **5 mentions captured**
- **3 networks identified:**
  - collegebesties.com (22 models)
  - collegeclubb.com (22 models) 
  - myfriendss.com (1 model)
- **Loop confirmed:** 3.5 hours (4 full loops observed)
- **Caption template:** "Everyone's college crush finally launched her OF 🤭 💕 @ninacarlson"
- **Current fans:** 1,044 (+348 total, ~26/hour)

### Key Understanding: "Ghost Promotion"
- Tags are ephemeral - posts delete after 5 minutes
- Drives traffic without cluttering tagged model's feed
- Why 4.5 min cron window is critical (catch before deletion)
- Notifications vanish when source post is deleted

### Big Accounts in Rotation
- ellabbyxo (720K likes)
- livdavies (422K likes)  
- avajean (254K likes)

### Dashboard
- Live at: https://nina-dashboard.vercel.app
- Data: `nina-dashboard/data.json`
- Backup: `research/ninacarlson-tracking.json`

### Cron Job Active
- Running every 4.5 minutes
- Will continue until Kiefer says STOP
- Tags endpoint intermittent - using fan growth as proxy when needed

### Check Log
| Time | Fans | New Tags | New Mentions | Notes |
|------|------|----------|--------------|-------|
| ~2:57pm | 1,079 | 0 (rate limited) | 0 | Tags tab hit cloudflare rate limit, queued posts at 3:23/3:53/4:23/4:53pm |

## Lesson Reinforced
**Don't stop monitoring until explicitly told.** Earlier mistake of stopping at 4:50am cost 5+ hours of data. Now running continuously regardless of "loop confirmed" status.

*Tracking continues via cron job*

## Evening Session (6-7pm) - Continued Tracking

### Tag Count Progress
- 53 → 58 tags captured this session
- New models: jennashaw (243K), babylola18/Lola (360K)
- Multiple loop confirmations: ellabbyxo, rowanpierce, carlenewalker, babylola18

### Fan Growth
- 1,154 → 1,174 fans (+20 in ~1 hour evening)
- Total: 696 → 1,174 (+478 in ~21.5 hours, ~22/hour)

### Major Finding: Hidden Network Models
Kiefer asked to compare captured models vs landing pages:
- **collegeclubb.com**: 39 models listed
- **collegebesties.com**: 26 models listed  
- **myfriendss.com**: 35 models listed
- **Total on sites**: 100 models

**26 of 53 captured models (50%) are NOT on any landing page!**
Including Nina herself - has collegebesties in bio but isn't listed.
Actual network = 125+ models with ~25% hidden.

### Dashboard Updates
- Added Full Model Roster table (username, bio site, website match status)
- Added Nina to roster (tracking target, not on any site)
- Fixed lanitaylor → "Lani" ≠ "Lanie" (different people, both unlisted)
- babylola18 (Lola😻) 360K - matches "Lola" on collegeclubb

### Tracking Status @ 7pm
- 58 tags, 19 mentions, 53 unique models
- Cron running every 4.5 min
- Dashboard: https://nina-dashboard.vercel.app
