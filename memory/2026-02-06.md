## ninacarlson Tracking (Ongoing)

### 🎉 1K MILESTONE HIT!
- Started: 696 fans (midnight)
- Hit 1K: ~10:45am AST
- Growth: +304 fans in ~11.5 hours (~27/hour average)

### Tracking Stats (as of ~1:30pm)
- **46 unique tags captured** (Loop 4 confirmed)
- **5 mentions captured**
- **3 networks identified:**
  - collegebesties.com (22 models)
  - collegeclubb.com (22 models) 
  - myfriendss.com (1 model)
- **Loop confirmed:** 3.5 hours (4 full loops observed)
- **Caption template:** "Everyone's college crush finally launched her OF 🤭 💕 @ninacarlson"
- **Current fans:** 1,044 (+348 total, ~26/hour)

### Key Understanding: "Ghost Promotion"
- Tags are ephemeral - posts delete after 5 minutes
- Drives traffic without cluttering tagged model's feed
- Why 4.5 min cron window is critical (catch before deletion)
- Notifications vanish when source post is deleted

### Big Accounts in Rotation
- ellabbyxo (720K likes)
- livdavies (422K likes)  
- avajean (254K likes)

### Dashboard
- Live at: https://nina-dashboard.vercel.app
- Data: `nina-dashboard/data.json`
- Backup: `research/ninacarlson-tracking.json`

### Cron Job Active
- Running every 4.5 minutes
- Will continue until Kiefer says STOP
- Tags endpoint intermittent - using fan growth as proxy when needed

## Lesson Reinforced
**Don't stop monitoring until explicitly told.** Earlier mistake of stopping at 4:50am cost 5+ hours of data. Now running continuously regardless of "loop confirmed" status.
