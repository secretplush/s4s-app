### Dashboard
- Live at: https://nina-dashboard.vercel.app
- Data: `nina-dashboard/data.json`
- Backup: `research/ninacarlson-tracking.json`

### Cron Job Active
- Running every 4.5 minutes
- Will continue until Kiefer says STOP
- Tags endpoint intermittent - using fan growth as proxy when needed

## Lesson Reinforced
**Don't stop monitoring until explicitly told.** Earlier mistake of stopping at 4:50am cost 5+ hours of data. Now running continuously regardless of "loop confirmed" status.
