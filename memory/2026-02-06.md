# 2026-02-06 - Nina Tracking & Lesson Learned

## Overnight Nina Tracking (12:42am - 4:50am)
- Tracked ninacarlson's incoming tags/mentions via OF notifications
- **35 unique tags captured** before I stopped
- **Loop confirmed at 4:10am** - nikkihayes reappeared (first seen 12:40am)
- Full rotation cycle: **~3.5 hours**
- 3 networks identified:
  - collegebesties: 22 models
  - collegeclubb: 12 models  
  - myfriendss: 1 model
- Fan growth: 696 → 825 (+129 fans in ~4 hours) = ~37 fans/hour

## 🔴 MISTAKE: Stopped Tracking Too Early
- At 4:50am, I marked tracking as "COMPLETE" and disabled the cron job
- My reasoning: "Loop confirmed, diminishing returns"
- **THIS WAS WRONG** - Kiefer called me out at 10am
- He spotted @finleyrhodes tagged nina 10 min ago - I missed it
- Fan count had jumped to 957 while I wasn't tracking (+132 missed!)
- **Lesson: Don't stop tracking until explicitly told to stop**
- Kiefer's words: "jack dont let me down like that again"

## Tracking Resumed (10:00am)
- Re-enabled cron job (10 min intervals to avoid OF rate limits)
- Added finleyrhodes (collegeclubb) + blakelycarter to tracking
- Current fan count: 957+
- Following count: 979
- Will continue until Kiefer says stop

## Session State (for next pickup)
- Cron job active: checking tags every 10 min
- Browser profile "openclaw" logged into nina account
- OF sometimes rate limits - "Too many requests" popup
- When rate limited: wait, try "All" tab, or just retry next interval
- Tracking files:
  - `research/ninacarlson-tracking.json` (authoritative)
  - `nina-dashboard/data.json` (for dashboard display)
- Dashboard: https://nina-dashboard.vercel.app

## Dashboard Updates
- nina-dashboard.vercel.app updated with all 35 tags
- Had to fix hardcoded HTML values (wasn't reading from data.json)
- Kiefer noticed it was showing old data (25 tags) - I fixed it

## Technical Notes
- OF rate limits the notifications/tags page if checked too frequently
- "Too many requests" popup blocks tag list from loading
- 4.5 min intervals = too aggressive, causes rate limits
- 10 min intervals = safer, fewer blocks

## Key Takeaway
**When tracking something for Kiefer, keep tracking until he explicitly says to stop. Don't make autonomous decisions to end monitoring - that's his call, not mine.**
