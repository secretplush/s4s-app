## 4:35 AM — Race Condition: Triple-Dispatch on Same Fans
Three sub-agents all processed the same 3 pending fans (152554038, 506069341, 535014582) because the dispatcher cron fired while webhook-triggered spawns were already running. Fans likely received 2-3x duplicate messages. 

**Fix needed:** Dispatcher should write fan IDs to dispatch-lock.json BEFORE spawning, not after. Or Railway should atomically clear pending on first read. Flag to Kiefer in morning report.
