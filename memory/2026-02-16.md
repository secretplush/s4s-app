## AI Chatbot Build — Milliexhart Pilot

### Deployed & Working
- Chatbot live on Railway (`s4s-worker-production.up.railway.app`)
- Target: milliexhart account (`acct_ebca85077e0a4b7da04cf14176466411`)
- Test user: sadieeblake (OF ID `526616700`)
- PPV sending confirmed working end-to-end — first PPV sent at $12.99 (bundle_1, 10 items)
- 29 vault categories mapped (bundle_1-10, vip_bundle_1-8, sexting_1-2, cwm)

### Key Features Built
- WPM-based typing delays (35-45 WPM + thinking pauses)
- Multi-message support (double/triple texts)
- Fan type detection (Silent Buyer, Chatty Fan, Window Shopper)
- Follow-up bump system (60min interval, unsends previous, max 3)
- Sent items tracking per fan (no duplicate content)
- Claude prompt forces first PPV within messages 5-8
- Debug logging at `/chatbot/status`, reset at `/chatbot/reset/:userId`

### Architecture Decision (agreed with Kiefer)
Three layers:
1. **AI Bot** — handles volume, bundle sales, qualifying
2. **Whale Handoff** — bot detects whale signals, flags to human chatter
3. **AI Review** — monitors human chatters, scores against playbook

### Open Issues
- **Pricing**: Kiefer flagged $12.99 may be too low — prior research showed ~$20 price points. Needs alignment.
- **Vault naming convention**: Proposed `[Tier] [Number] - [Content Level] (Description)` — team needs to reorganize milliexhart's vault
- **Photo/video split**: Can't reliably detect media types from API; using simple shuffled `ids` array instead

### Key Decisions
- Simple vault selection (not photo/video split) — the refactor broke things
- Let messages overlap naturally instead of cancelling queued messages
- "Sell the mystery" — never describe PPV content explicitly (chargeback protection)
- Bump unsend before new bump (anti-spam)
- Per-model personality cards (Phase 3) — same bot code, swap system prompt

### Major Iteration Session (afternoon)
Kiefer live-tested the bot extensively. Fixed iteratively:

**Bugs Fixed:** Mass DM gaslighting, "i dont have that" responses, wrong time of day, double PPVs, 2-item PPVs, double responses from rapid messages, PPV spam, repetitive "omg ur so bad", premature attachment, ignoring fan requests

**New Features:** Welcome sequence, PPV unlock auto-upsell, knowledge base from real converting sequences, self-deprecating + dom fantasy fan types, auto-detect new models for exclude lists, 3s message debounce

**Key Decision:** Removed hardcoded cooldowns — AI reads the room. Railway doesn't auto-deploy on push — must `railway redeploy --yes`.

**Exclude lists:** 56/58 done. jadexwilde added (58 models). sophiamurphy + tessaxsloane still missing newSub.

### Chatter Performance Data (24hr snapshot Feb 16)
- **$26,646 revenue** from 161 chatters, 39,889 messages
- **$0.67/message** revenue average — this is the benchmark for the AI bot
- **20.9% PPV conversion** (469/2,243 sent)
- Top performer: Danielle Angela Villarosa $7.99/msg (115 msgs, $919)
- 18 chatters sent 2,066 msgs with $0 revenue
- AI bot cost: ~$0.009/msg (Sonnet) — even 10% human efficiency = massively profitable
- 40,000 messages/day across agency = ~$360/day on Sonnet vs $110-160K/mo labor
- Data saved: `research/chatter-data/`
- 30-day transaction CSV received but truncated to 20 rows — need full file

### Railway Deploy Issue (CRITICAL)
Railway does NOT auto-deploy on git push. Must run `railway redeploy --yes` after every push. Cost 30+ min testing against old code.

### Next Steps
1. Get full 30-day transaction CSV from Kiefer
2. Build learning/feedback loop (track which tactics convert per fan)
3. Continue live testing — bot improving but still needs work on reading comprehension
4. Scale to 5 pilot models once milliexhart is solid
