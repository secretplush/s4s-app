## Multi-SFS Exclude List Refactor

### Completed
- Discovered 20 models have MULTIPLE SFS exclude lists (duplicate "New SFS Exclude", "SFS Exclude List 2.0", etc.) but code only used ONE per model
- Refactored `SFS_EXCLUDE_LISTS_HARDCODED` from `string` to `string[]` arrays (all 57 entries)
- Queried API to catalog all duplicate lists across all accounts

### Still TODO
- `loadSfsExcludeLists()` Redis serialization: `hset`/`hgetall` stores flat strings — needs `JSON.stringify`/`JSON.parse` for arrays
- `sfsExcludeLists` in-memory cache needs to handle arrays
- `sendMassDm()` must spread all list IDs into `excludedLists` param (currently reads single ID)

## Cross-Model SFS Exclude Clarification
- The saralovexx leak at 12:28 AM was because her SFS exclude list ID was wrong (`1262454399` didn't exist) — happened BEFORE the fix deployed
- SFS mass DMs use the SENDER's exclude lists, not the promoted model's — this is correct (protecting sender's VIP fans from promo spam)

## Auto-Managed Exclude Lists (Done)
- "🆕 New Sub 48hr" + "💬 Active Chat" lists with webhook handlers + cron cleanup
- Global webhook registered for `subscriptions.new` and `messages.received`
- `isFromQueue` field distinguishes mass vs direct messages
- Mass DM now excludes 3 list types: SFS Exclude + New Sub 48hr + Active Chat

## Chatbot (milliexhart) - Rebuilt
- API key fixed: `sk-ant-api03-rUejB43F...` (old $250 plan key, $50 added)
- Vault loading fixed: correct endpoint `/media/vault?limit=100` with pagination
- 542 vault items cataloged across tiers:
  - 💰 Bundles 1-10: 4 selfies → 4 full body (clothed) → strip video → nude pics
  - 💰 VIP Bundles 1-8: Premium topless content
  - 🫦 Sexting 1 & 2: Drip escalation sets (6 videos each, progressively more explicit)
  - 💦 CWM: Custom Welcome Message (NOT explicit — I was wrong)
- System prompt rebuilt with Nina playbook tactics
- Fan context awareness: checks spending history, adjusts approach
- Smart vault selection by category
- Natural response delays (30-180s based on message type)
- Test: sadieeblake (user 526616700) → milliexhart

## Three-Layer Chatbot Strategy (Agreed with Kiefer)
1. **AI Bot (Volume)**: Handles all new fans, bundle sales, basic flirting, qualifying — 24/7
2. **Whale Handoff**: Bot detects whale signals, flags to human chatter via Discord
3. **AI Review**: Monitors chatter-whale convos, scores against playbook, flags mistakes

## Content Structure (from Kiefer)
- **Bundles**: One-time PPV packages (selfies → full body → strip video → nudes)
- **Sexting Sets**: Drip escalation, piece by piece, each charged separately (way more revenue)
  - Uploaded to vault IN ORDER with description/price images alongside
  - Fan thinks it's real-time
- **Customs**: Fan-requested specific content, premium pricing
- 99% of money comes from 1% of fans (whales are everything)

## LTV Analysis (All 57 Models)
- Highest: winterclaire $57.37/fan, madsabigail $37.08, lindamarievip $37.03, saralovexx $27.96
- Lowest: caraaawesley $1.05/fan, keelydavidson $1.15, skyyroseee $1.24
- winterclaire secret: extreme GFE, 70% relationship talk, fans say "I love you", $29-200 PPVs accepted naturally

## AI Chatbot Roadmap Written
- research/ai-chatbot-roadmap.md
- 5 phases: Bundle Sales Bot → Qualification + Handoff → Multi-Model → Chatter Review → Full Auto + Sexting
- Team needs to provide: vault content descriptions, model branding/tone, Discord access

## Chatter Audit Bot (Design Only)
- Webhook → 12hr delay → pull conversations → AI score against playbook → Discord alert
- Needs: Discord webhook URL, scope confirmation from Kiefer
- Analyzed sadieeblake's 31 ad-acquired fans — found 4 critical chatter failures
