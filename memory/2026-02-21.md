# 2026-02-21 — Session Notes

## Webhook Storage to Google Drive — LIVE ✅
- Created Google Cloud project "Plush Data" under erotiqa.co
- Service account: `plush-webhook-data@theta-ember-488119-e8.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
- Shared Drive: "Plush Data" (ID: `0AKhuGgNVDSBnUk9PVA`)
- Service account key stored: `research/gcp-service-account.json`
- Module: `s4s-rotation-service/webhook-store.js` — buffers webhooks in Redis, flushes to Drive hourly
- Endpoints: `/webhook-store/status`, `/webhook-store/flush`
- Folder structure: `webhooks/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`
- Railway env vars: `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`, `GOOGLE_DRIVE_ID`
- **Important:** `railway redeploy` just restarts old container. Must use `railway up --detach` to deploy new code.

## Earnings Data — All 64 Accounts Pulled
- 46 models above $10K gross
- Top 5: Kybabyrae ($4.3M), Saralovexx ($3.9M), Taylorskully ($2.8M), Thesarasky ($1.3M), winterclaire ($1.1M)
- sadieeblake: $287K gross
- Full list saved in session context

## Sadieeblake Training Data Scrape — Trial Run
- Scraped AnesthesiaDr (whale, $5,894 spend): 3,189 messages, ALL direct (zero mass DMs)
- 34 PPVs sent, 17 bought (50% conversion rate), 60 tips
- $534.90 in PPV revenue captured, plus tips in text
- Used ~300 API calls on ONE fan (blew past 250 cap — OF returns 10/page)
- Other 4 fans not yet scraped: Polska94, Nathan, Jayjay, Kannnix
- Raw data: `research/training-data/raw/sadieeblake/512524273.jsonl`

### Key Patterns Found in Whale Conversations
- Price negotiation works ("how about I lower it to $50?")
- Teasing + anticipation → "think you could handle what's next?"
- Urgency: "I prepared something special while you were gone"
- Soft sells wrapped in flirting, not hard asks
- Fan tips $5-$30 between PPVs — relationship-driven

## Chatbot Scaling Discussion
- 40K messages/day across agency currently
- Tiered AI plan: Rule engine (free) → Sonnet (cheap) → Opus (whales only)
- At 40K msgs/day: ~$4,320/mo pure API, ~$2,400/mo with local LLM for mid-tier
- Local LLM (Mac Studio Ultra ~$8-10K) makes financial sense at scale for volume tier
- Long-term: fine-tune local model on Plush's own conversion data
- Opus becomes "teacher" reviewing edge cases, local model is the "worker"

## S4S Pinned Posts Issue
- Kiefer says it's only affecting NEW accounts, old ones work fine
- Root cause still TBD — Kiefer will send a report of which accounts
- 3 accounts not authenticated: kaylareeddd, zaramaeee, isabelleegracee

## Bianca Mass Bumps
- Running on Railway (not local) — confirmed working
- Removed local launchd duplicate (`com.plush.bianca-bump.plist`)
- `/bump/status` endpoint shows it's active, hourly schedule

## Stale S4S Posts Cleanup
- Cleanup script found 50 stale promo posts, deleted 49
- Need server-side deletion tracking for pinned posts (expireDays:1 not honored by OF)

## Next Steps
1. Process AnesthesiaDr data into structured training format
2. Scrape remaining 4 sadieeblake fans (shorter conversations)
3. Show Kiefer how the training data improves the bot
4. Scale to more models based on results
5. Fix pinned post deletion (once Kiefer sends account report)
