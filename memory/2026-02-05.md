## Tag Network Analysis: jackiesmithh

Created Google Sheet analyzing jackiesmithh's tagging network:
- **Sheet:** https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1psHspTsxZXV-Ammd7W1zlcylfkyzZWjDGT5kaHlFzjM/edit
- **TAGS tab:** 1 account (erotiqa)
- **MENTIONS tab:** 10 accounts

### Key Finding: Zero Competitor Infiltration
All 11 accounts checked — **none** link to myfriendss.com or collegebesties.com.

Instead, all non-Plush accounts link to **t.me/girlsgroupxo** (erotiqa's promo telegram group).

### erotiqa Network
erotiqa appears to run their own cross-promo network separate from the competitor we've been tracking. All tagged accounts in jackiesmithh's network are part of this telegram group.

### Plush Models in Network
Three Plush models appeared in jackiesmithh's mentions:
- maddieharperr
- aviannaarose  
- zoeemonroe

Interestingly, they also have girlsgroupxo links in their bios — worth investigating if this is intentional cross-promo or needs cleanup.

## Deep Analysis Dashboard (Late Night 2/5)

Built comprehensive dashboard for Kiefer analyzing jackiesmithh:

### Revenue (48h)
- **$231.71** from 11 purchases, 6 fans
- Top spender: Wdm ($100.42 - 4 purchases)
- Second: Brian ($65.20 - 3 purchases)
- Average purchase: $21.07

### Critical Finding: No Counter-Offers
Found live example of missed sale:
- Wdm asked for $100 custom → said no → chatter said "no worries"
- **Should have counter-offered** ($50? → $35 with urgency?)
- Competitor playbook: always 2-3 counter-offers before accepting "no"

### Key Recommendations
1. Train chatters on counter-offer scripts
2. Add urgency timers (6 mins like competitor)
3. "Sad response" for unopened PPVs
4. Fake hesitation for premium asks
