## S4S App — Major Expansion

### New Models Added to OF API (30 total now)
- Kiefer added 11 new models manually via OF API dashboard after our script hit server errors (billing was past due on $299/mo OF API subscription)
- I added all 15 new authenticated models to `models-data.ts` and deployed
- 3 accounts still failing auth: andreaelizabethxo, xoharper (2FA), brittanyhalden (wrong password)
- ~16 models from spreadsheet still not connected to OF API (remaining from the 34 total in spreadsheet)
- **Taylorskully** = promo-only (no inbound shoutouts) — she owes Kiefer money, this is payback

### Code Changes
- Updated `ACCOUNT_IDS` in distribute/route.ts, rotation/generate-schedule/route.ts with all 30 models
- **Fixed critical bug**: distribute endpoint wasn't saving vault mappings to Vercel KV — only returned to browser. Added KV save on successful distribution.
- **Fixed gap scanner**: was only checking KV (which had old 15-model data). Now syncs IndexedDB → KV before scanning gaps.
- Built "Check Vault Gaps" feature — scans all 30 models, finds missing vault mappings, "Fix All Gaps" button
- Built "Sync New Model" API route (sync-new-model/route.ts)
- Built vault-gaps API route

### Architecture Lesson
- Vault mappings live in TWO places: IndexedDB (browser, source of truth from UI distributions) and Vercel KV (used by rotation service + gap scanner)
- Must sync IndexedDB → KV before gap scanning
- Distribute endpoint now saves to KV too (going forward)

### Nina's OF Account
- Still logged in on openclaw browser as @ninacarlson
- Email: mia26page@outlook.com
- Don't have password — just session cookie

### S4S Rotation
- Was stopped while Kiefer added models, restarted by Kiefer ~6:35pm Feb 9
- Running healthy: 1,254+ tags by mid-morning Feb 10
- Still only 15 models in rotation (new ones need vault mappings distributed first)

### OF API Billing
- Subscription went past due causing all authenticate API calls to return "Server Error"
- Kiefer resolved billing ~5:49pm Feb 9
- Dashboard worked but authenticate endpoint was broken until billing fixed
