## Network Mapping COMPLETE (11:35pm)

### Competitor Network Size: 60 MODELS

**collegebesties.com: 24 models**
Brittany, Maia, Kamryn, Hartley, Margot, Ellison, Cleo Thompson, Hazel, Khloe, Stephanie, Jordin, Brynlee, Amber, Lanie, Evie, Dakota, Cora, Quinn, Miley, Autumn, Lexi, Blair, Jovie, Piper

**myfriendss.com: 36 models (DIFFERENT network)**

**Key Insight:** TWO separate brand networks under one operation. This is how they achieve 7x revenue — 5x the model count doing coordinated cross-promo.

### Gig Social Account (REAL ONE)
- gigsocial.com (not gigsocial.io)
- Registered as "Plush Agency"
- Email verified
- Ready to explore marketplace

## Late Night Research (11:40pm+)

### Promo Seller Deep Dive

**mandysweet2020 (@mandysweet2020)**
- 811K likes — MASSIVE promo account
- Free subscription
- Active shoutout seller
- Recent tags: @miasandberg, @kinkynicole
- Posts automated shoutouts tagging one model at a time
- Posts expire after ~1 day

**Lina (@lina_7)**
- 132K likes
- Free subscription  
- Active promo seller (different network from competitor)
- Recent shoutouts: @robynnparker, @jenniedavis, @beckymorgan, @littlelian, @zoedalby, @kinsleypaige

### Key Insight: Promo Market Structure

There are MULTIPLE promo networks:
1. Big accounts (100K-800K+ likes) sell shoutouts
2. Smaller models PAY for those shoutouts
3. Posts tag paying models → exposure to big fanbase
4. Gig Social is the marketplace connecting buyers and sellers

**The competitor likely buys promo from:**
- mandysweet2020 (811K) and similar accounts
- Scales across many promo sellers for reach

### Gig Social Blocker
- Profile incomplete — requires photo upload to access marketplace
- Can see dashboard but can't browse sellers without completing profile
- Created `research/competitor-promo-intel.md` with full analysis

## Action Items for Tomorrow

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Complete Gig Social profile** (upload photo) to access marketplace pricing
2. **Sign up for OnlyFansAPI.com** trial
3. **Get actual pricing** for our scale
4. **Build tagging POC** with 1-2 test accounts
5. **Review research docs** with Kiefer

## Communication Preferences

- Daily reports ~10-11am AST
- Format: what I worked on, what's next, what's broken, ideas
- Primary channel: Telegram
