## Onboarding Flow

1. Model receives onboarding link (could use sliding testimonials, earnings graphs)
2. Model signs contract
3. Fills out onboarding typeform → auto-populates creators sheet
4. Texts admin and billing
5. Downloads app (website added to home screen)

### What Models Want (marketing angle)
- Anonymous
- Passive income
- Wealth
- Lifestyle (travel, freedom)
- Community (girl groups, friends who do this)

### What Plush Wants
- Signed contract
- Content uploaded (topless+)
- Streaming frequently and properly
- Collaboration between models

## Account Setup (Onboarding Team)

1. Create plush.la email for Google (Chat + Drive)
2. Create iluvplush email for OnlyFans (model doesn't access)
3. Create OnlyFans account with referral code from Erotiqa (main page) - IMPORTANT for revenue
4. Verify referral went through (email to erotiqa OF account)
5. Send model the Google Chat logins → OF logins are in gchat
6. Model verifies OF (clear ID on black background) - takes 24-48 hours
7. Model inputs W9 only (no email verification needed after)
8. Team changes password, gives model OnlyMonster CRM access instead (hides withdrawal/password features for security)

### Daisio Payment Processing
- Money goes to bank under "model's name"
- Split via Daisio (they own/operate it)
- Need website "powered by daisio split pay" for legitimacy

## Content Requirements

Bundles needed:
- Selfies
- Full body pics
- Stripping video
- Nude and implied nude pics

Progress bar / gamification could help motivate uploads

### Model Psychology Notes
- "Laziest of the lazy"
- Barely motivated by money
- Not tech savvy
- Referral person needs to assist throughout

### Referral Bonuses
- $200 for content uploads
- $200 for topless-xxx content
- 1% of monthly revenue after first month
- $200 if model streams 20 hours in first 15 days
- $200 for 3000 peak viewers stream

## Sales Team Launch

Once content uploaded:
1. Onboarding team confirms quality
2. Endorses model to sales team
3. Sales team sets up OF storefront
4. Assigns team: Chatters, Managers, Head Manager
5. Fills out MMS sheet (branding info, team members, sales tracking, custom requests)
6. Sets launch date

## Traffic/Promotion (Internal)

### Erotiqa Master Page Slots
- Posts: 15 girls
- DM slots: 10 girls
- Friends lists: 10 girls
- Pinned posts: 5 girls
- Rotation to keep fresh

### Girls Groups (15 girls each)
Cross-promotion shoutout technique:
- 15 girls in each other's friends lists (15 different orders)
- Each girl pins another girl for 24 hours (rotating)
- Each girl's page shouts out 1 girl every 2 hours (12/day, 12am-11pm)
- Currently only have ONE girls group
- Could be automated instead of using Filipinos

### Chaturbate Streaming
- Model contacts CB team (3rd phone number)
- Goal: 4-hour stream, 5 days/week, 4 weeks = ~80 hours in 30 days
- CB gives 30 days extra promo for new streamers
- Team sets up account, model verifies
- cbhours.com tracks streaming stats

### Supporting Infrastructure
- DMCA monitoring (leaks happen after streams)
- Model Telegram for announcements (going live, daily OF posts)
- Proxies + Filipinos currently manage Telegrams

## Marketing Gaps (Kiefer's Wish List)

Not currently doing but sees opportunity:
- Virtual phone farms for dating apps
- Instagram
- Reddit
- Twitter
- YouTube
- TikTok
- Paid ad sources (ModelSearcher etc.)
- AI content generation / AI remix of existing creators

## Competitor Analysis (THE BIG ONE)

Agency making so much money they look like money laundering.

### Their Stats vs Plush

| Fans @ $500+ spend | 126 | - |
| Fans @ $1000+ spend | - | 30 |

### Their Automation (Key Intelligence)
- **Tagging automation**: Model tagged in post every minute for 5 mins, new girl each post, posts deleted after 5 mins
- Forces posts to top of feed constantly
- Rotates through ~23 models continuously
- Appears to use OnlyFans API integration

### Their Mass Message Strategy
Times (AST): 5:30pm, 3:30pm, 1:30pm, 12:30pm, 10:30am (sometimes skips some)
- Bundle: 5 pics + 5 videos (XXX content)
- Average price: $20
- Sales: 85-95/day = ~$1,800/day per model
- Sometimes same bundle, different caption

### Their Revenue Breakdown (daily per model)
- Mass messages: ~$1,800
- Wall posts (PPV on main feed): ~$550
- Tips (customs?): ~$700
- Other (DM sales, sequences): ~$3,450
- **TOTAL: ~$6,500/day = ~$195k/month**

### How They Get Fans
- Internal cross-promotion (the tagging system)
- Buying promo from pages on Gig Social, Fleshbot, ModelSearcher
- Examples found in tagged users:
  - stephaniequinn
  - giulianacabrazia_
  - lina_7
  - mandysweet2020
  - lunaskye9
  - arianahunt126

### Key Account for Research
- https://onlyfans.com/Stephaniequinn (competitor model Kiefer has access to)
- Can see shoutouts, DMs, collegebesties/myfriendss links in bios

## Ongoing Model Management

Weekly deliverables for models:
- Content for bundles, main feed, customs, drip sets
- Upload to starred GDrive folders

Custom requests flow:
1. Chatter negotiates with fan
2. Sends to model (price + description)
3. Model approves/denies/adjusts
4. Team follows up until complete

Pain point: Hard for models to track everything. Need:
- Consolidated dashboard
- Calendar scheduling
- Availability input
- AI-assisted follow-up (Filipinos limited in nuance)

## Current Internal Comms

- Discord for team communication (works well)
- Need to think about AI optimization for:
  - Sales tactics
  - Fan interactions
  - Mass messages
  - 1-on-1 chat
  - Model management

## Key Opportunities Identified

1. **Automation** - Replicate competitor's OnlyFans API tagging system
2. **Mass messaging optimization** - AI-driven timing, content, pricing
3. **Traffic acquisition** - Gig Social, Fleshbot, ModelSearcher promo buys
4. **Model app/dashboard** - Streamline content uploads, calendar, checklist
5. **AI chatters** - Replace/augment Filipino team limitations
6. **Marketing expansion** - Social media, dating apps, virtual phone farms
7. **AI content** - Generate or remix content
8. **More girls groups** - Only have 1 currently, could scale
9. **Daisio website** - Build legitimacy page
10. **Onboarding improvements** - Testimonials, earnings graphs, progress bars
