# Plush Chatter Sales Playbook

*For the Plush chatter team. Read this, memorize it, use it every shift.*

## The #1 Rule

**Never accept "no." Never say "no worries." Every hesitation is an opportunity to try a different angle.**

When a fan says they can't afford it, won't buy, or goes silent — that is NOT the end. That is the beginning. You have at least 5 tactics to try before you move on:

1. Lower the price
2. Create urgency (unsend threat)
3. Make them feel guilty
4. Challenge them
5. Try a completely different content angle

If you say "no worries" or "that's okay," you just threw away money. The fan was ALREADY interested — they subscribed. Your job is to close.

---

## Welcome Flow (First 5 Minutes)

When a new fan subscribes, the clock starts. You have **5 minutes** to send the first message.

### Step 1: Instant Welcome (within 60 seconds)

> "hey! 💕 omg i just saw you subscribed… thank you so much 🥺 what's your name?"

**Why this works:**
- Feels personal, not automated
- The 🥺 sets the vulnerable/cute tone immediately
- Asking their name gets them TALKING

### Step 2: Personalize (after they respond)

If they give a name:
> "omg [Name] that's such a cute name 🥰 where are you from?"

If they give a location:
> "[City/State]?? no way, i've always wanted to go there 😍"

**The goal:** Get them in a CONVERSATION. Fans who talk are fans who buy.

### Step 3: First PPV (within 10-15 minutes of conversation)

Once they're chatting, transition naturally:
> "i have something i want to show you but im kinda nervous 🙈"
> "promise you won't judge me? 🥺"

Then send a $9.99-$14.40 PPV. This is the starter price. NEVER higher for first purchase.

### If They Don't Respond to Welcome

Wait 20 minutes, then:
> "did i scare you off already? 🥺 i was really hoping to talk to you..."

Wait 2 hours, then add them to mass PPV rotation (Silent Bundle Buyer treatment).

## Buyer Types & How to Handle Each

### Type 1: Silent Bundle Buyer (~20% of buyers)

**Who they are:** Never chats, never responds to DMs, but consistently unlocks PPVs from mass messages.

**Examples:** John Gerrick ($328.80 — bought $35 PPVs with zero conversation), Karter, Jack75

**How to handle:**
- Do NOT waste chatter time on conversation attempts
- Add to ALL mass PPV sends
- Send variety: bundles at $14.40, $22.40, $35, and $50
- They respond to quantity, not conversation
- Send 2-3 PPVs per day via mass message
- **Never remove them from lists** — they're passive income

### Type 2: Emotional Connection Buyer

**Who they are:** They want a GIRLFRIEND, not content. They crave attention, conversation, and feeling special. Many will spend without ever receiving nudes.

**Example: Jayy (@u299750197) — spent $76 with NO nudes delivered**

How it worked:
- Used "I'm new/shy 🥺" deflection TWICE when he asked for explicit content
- Fan APOLOGIZED both times for pushing
- Still engaged days later: "I waited all day to talk before bed"
- Pure GFE (girlfriend experience) monetization

**Scripts for this type:**

When they ask for nudes:
> "im still new here and shy 🥺 i promise u will be the first to see me naked 💕 but im not ready yet...🙈"

When they push harder:
> "do you really think that about me? 🥺 i thought you actually liked talking to me..."

Fan will apologize and keep spending on non-explicit PPVs.

**Key insight:** These fans can be monetized INDEFINITELY with just attention and emotional connection. Sell the relationship, not the content.

### Type 3: Demanding Skeptic

**Who they are:** Calls out reused content, complains about prices, says things aren't worth it — but KEEPS BUYING.

**Example: Charles — caught a lie, still spent $307.20**

What happened:
- Charles noticed he'd been sent the same video before
- Chatter responded: "wdym love i never showed u these vids before 🥺"
- Charles pushed back
- Chatter held frame with vulnerability
- Charles bought $99 PPV ANYWAY

**Scripts for this type:**

When they call out reused content:
> "wdym love i never showed u these vids before 🥺"
> "are you sure? maybe you're thinking of someone else 💕"

When they say it's not worth it:
> "that actually really hurts 🥺 i put a lot of effort into that for you..."

When they complain about price:
> "would it help if i lower it a bit just for u? 💕"

**The rule:** The 🥺 emoji deflects almost ANY accusation. Don't argue. Don't get defensive. Just go vulnerable. They'll apologize and keep buying.

### Type 4: Negotiator Whale

**Who they are:** Big spenders who want to feel like VIPs. They'll pay premium prices for exclusivity and status.

**Example: Toph94 (@u241909752) — paid $150 tip just for "first VIP" status**

**Scripts for this type:**

Create tiers:
> "i only have a few VIP spots and you'd be my FIRST 🥺 it would mean so much to me..."
> "$150 and you're my #1 VIP. no one else gets what you get 💕"

Make them feel exclusive:
> "do you promise to keep it just between us… if i show you something i shouldn't? 🙈"
> "i've never shown anyone this before... you're the only one i trust 🥺"

**Key insight:** They're buying STATUS, not content. Make them feel like they own a piece of you that nobody else has.

### Type 5: Sexual Energy Matcher

**Who they are:** Responds to explicit escalation. Matches your sexual energy and tips during peak arousal moments.

**Example: Axe ($331.20) — sends videos TO the model, buys $100+ bundles, high sexual energy**

**How to handle:**
- Match their energy level exactly
- Escalate content descriptions progressively
- Don't be shy — go explicit in text
- Tips come NATURALLY during arousal peaks, not from asking
- Keep the tension building, never fully satisfy

**Scripts:**
> "mmm you have no idea what you do to me 🥵"
> "i can't stop thinking about what you said..."
> "you're making it really hard to be good rn 😈"

---

## Core Tactics (with Exact Scripts)

### Tactic 1: FOMO / Unsend Threat 🔥

**When to use:** Fan hesitates on a PPV, goes quiet after seeing the price, or says "maybe later."

**Scripts:**
> "i might unsend it soon before i lose my nerve 🥺"
> "but ill just unsend ig, u dont want it"
> "im gonna take it down... i shouldn't have sent that 🙈"

**Why it works:** Creates URGENCY. Fan thinks the content will disappear. Fear of missing out > price resistance.

**Real result:** Justin panicked and paid $307 after unsend threat.

**Rule:** If fan doesn't buy within 30 minutes, deploy this tactic.

---

### Tactic 2: Challenge / Flip 🔥

**When to use:** Fan says "is it worth it?", "prove it", or hesitates but stays engaged.

**Scripts:**
> "what's stopping you? 😈"
> "only if you prove it to me that you really want it x"
> "prove you're not just here to waste my time 😏"
> "show me how bad you want it then 😏"

**Why it works:** Flips the power dynamic. Instead of YOU selling to THEM, THEY have to prove themselves to YOU.

**⚠️ NEVER say "trust me, you'd love it."** That's begging. Make THEM chase YOU.

**Real result:** Soccerguy0990 tipped $200 after being told "only if you prove it to me that you really want it x"

---

### Tactic 3: Vulnerability / 🥺 Defense 🔥

**When to use:** Fan catches a lie, complains, pushes back, or gets aggressive.

**Scripts:**
> "wdym love i never showed u these vids before 🥺"
> "im still new here and shy 🥺"
> "do you really think that 🥺"
> "that actually really hurts... 🥺"

**Why it works:** The 🥺 emoji is your SHIELD. It turns any accusation into an emotional moment. Fan feels bad for pushing. Fan apologizes. Fan keeps buying.

**Real result:** Charles caught a lie about reused content. Chatter used 🥺 denial. Charles apologized and spent $307.20 total.

---

### Tactic 4: Price Drop Offer

**When to use:** Fan clearly wants content but won't buy at current price.

**Script:**
> "would it help if i lower it a bit just for u? 💕"
> "i lowered it just for u because i really want u to see it 💕"

**Rules:**
- Drop 20-30% (e.g., $14.40 → $9.99, $50 → $35)
- Getting SOMETHING is always better than getting NOTHING
- Only use after other tactics fail
- Frame it as a SPECIAL favor for THEM, not desperation

---

### Tactic 5: Guilt / Silent Pressure

**When to use:** Fan goes quiet after seeing a PPV or mid-conversation.

**Scripts:**
> "Baby... i thought we talked"
> "..."
> "you're really gonna leave me hanging like that? 🥺"
> "i was really enjoying talking to you... 💔"

**Why it works:** Silence + guilt makes fan feel they OWE you a response. The "..." is powerful — it implies hurt without words.

**Real result:** Soccerguy0990 ($826.40 in 3 days) was managed with "Baby... i thought we talked" + "..." when pushing for more explicit content. He stayed and kept buying.

### Tactic 6: Playful Challenge Loop (for Tips) 🔥🔥🔥

**This is the HIGHEST-VALUE tactic. Memorize it.**

**Real example: Soccerguy0990 — $270 in 5 minutes**

| Step | Who | What Happens | Money |
|------|-----|-------------|-------|
| 1 | Fan | Tips and asks "What does that get me?" | $20 |
| 2 | You | Send video + "💕💕" | — |
| 3 | Fan | "And that?" | $50 |
| 4 | You | Send 2 more vids + "xxx😘" | — |
| 5 | You | **"but you know it always gets better 👀"** | — |
| 6 | Fan | "Prove it to me!" | — |
| 7 | You | **"only if you prove it to me that you really want it x"** | — |
| 8 | Fan | "Show me what you've got then!" | **$200** |

**The formula:**
1. Fan tips → Deliver content
2. Hint there's more: "but you know it always gets better 👀"
3. Fan challenges → Flip it back: "only if you prove it to me"
4. Fan tips MORE to prove themselves
5. Repeat

**Never ask for tips directly.** Make them WANT to prove themselves.

---

### Tactic 7: Request-Fulfillment Loop

**When to use:** Fan asks for specific content.

**How it works:**
1. Fan requests something specific
2. Deliver it (or closest available content)
3. They ask for more
4. Deliver
5. Repeat forever

**Don't overthink it.** If they keep asking and you keep delivering, money keeps flowing. Just keep the loop going.

---

### Tactic 8: Secret/Exclusivity Play

**When to use:** With any fan to increase perceived value.

**Scripts:**
> "do you promise to keep it just between us… if i show you something i shouldn't? 🙈"
> "i've never shown anyone this before..."
> "keep it just between us 🥺"

**Why it works:** Creates a "conspiracy" — fan feels like it's you and them against the world. Content feels more valuable because it's "secret."

## Magic Price Points

| Tier | Price Range | When to Use |
|------|------------|-------------|
| 🟢 Starter | $9.99 - $14.40 | First EVER purchase from a new fan |
| 🟡 Second | $19.80 - $22.40 | After fan's first buy |
| 🟠 Third | $39.70 - $50.00 | After 2+ purchases |
| 🔴 Premium | $99+ | After multiple purchases, whale territory |
| 💎 VIP | $150+ | Tips/custom, whale-only |

### Rules:

- **NEVER start a new fan at $39.70+.** Start at $9.99-$14.40, hook them, THEN escalate.
- **$14.40 is the magic number** — more fans buy at this price than any other.
- **$307.20 is the ceiling** for catalog exhaustion (18 PPVs). After this, you need fresh content or custom offers.
- **Average PPV per whale:** ~$25 per unlock (from Soccerguy0990 data: $826 ÷ 33 = $25.04)

---

## ❌ NEVER DO THIS

### ❌ "trust me, you'd love it :)"

**Why it's bad:** You're TELLING, not SELLING. No urgency, no emotion, no hook. Fan has zero reason to act NOW.

**What to say instead:**
> "i might unsend it before i get too nervous 🥺"
> "what's stopping you? 😈"

---

### ❌ "same as u"

**Why it's bad:** Dead-end response. Kills conversation momentum. Fan asked "talking about what?" — that's CURIOSITY, that's ENGAGEMENT. You killed it.

**What to say instead:**
> "haha wouldn't you like to know 😏 what do YOU want to talk about?"

---

### ❌ "haha, I'm not really looking for one tbh"

**Context:** Fan asked to be your Valentine ON VALENTINE'S DAY and chatter rejected him. He was ready to spend.

**Why it's bad:** You shut down a fan who was EMOTIONALLY INVESTED and ready to open his wallet.

**What to say instead:**
> "omg that's so sweet 🥺 no one's ever asked me that before... maybe you could be my first? 💕"

---

### ❌ Sending a PPV Then Going Silent

**Why it's bad:** A locked PPV sitting unopened is DEAD MONEY.

**Rule: NEVER let a locked PPV sit for more than 30 minutes without a follow-up message.**

Follow up with urgency, guilt, or a price drop (see Follow-Up Rules below).

---

### ❌ Ignoring Fans Who Respond

**Example:** TonyDaTiger said "Tony from Cali" — got one reply and was then ghosted. He came from a PAID AD. We PAID for him to be here.

**Rule: If a fan responds to ANYTHING, they get a conversation within 5 minutes.**

Every response is a sales opportunity. Every ignored response is money lost.

---

### ❌ "no worries" / "that's okay" When Fan Declines

**Why it's bad:** You're giving them permission to NOT buy. Never let them off the hook that easy.

**What to say instead:** Counter-offer with a price drop, create urgency, or try a different angle. ALWAYS have another move.

---

## Follow-Up Rules

**Print this. Tape it to your monitor.**

| Situation | Timing | What to Send |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| PPV sent, not opened | 30 min | "you're really gonna leave me like that? 🥺" |
| PPV sent, not opened | 2 hours | "im gonna unsend it, u clearly dont want to see me 😔" |
| PPV sent, not opened | 6 hours | Price drop — "i lowered it just for u because i really want u to see it 💕" |
| Fan went quiet mid-convo | 20 min | "did i scare you off? 🥺" |
| Fan went quiet mid-convo | 1 hour | "i was really enjoying talking to you... 💔" |
| Fan responded to anything | 5 min MAX | Start a full conversation |
| Fan tipped | Immediately | Deliver content + hint at more (Tactic 6) |

---

## ⚠️ Whale Protection Rules

**Top spenders ($500+) need SPECIAL treatment:**

- **Do NOT send them S4S promo or mass messages about other models.** They want exclusivity. Cross-promo feels like betrayal.
- Soccerguy0990 ($826) almost churned because he saw promo for other girls: *"It does make me sad that I'm getting more in an ad for a different page of you when I'm trying to support you here."*
- **Whales want to feel like the ONLY fan.** Personalize everything. Use their name. Remember details they shared.
- **Never auto-message whales.** Always hand-chat.

---

## The Character You're Playing

You are NOT a customer service rep. You are a **SALESPERSON** playing a **CHARACTER**.

The character is a girl who:

| Trait | How It Shows |
|-------|-------------|
| Slightly vulnerable | "im still new here 🥺" |
| Gets hurt when fans don't buy | "that really hurts... 🥺" |
| Creates urgency | "i might unsend it 🙈" |
| Never takes no for an answer | Always has another angle |
| Makes fans feel SPECIAL | "you're the only one i trust" |
| Is slightly innocent/shy | "im still a virgin baby" |
| Playfully challenges | "prove you want it 😏" |

### The Business Reality

- Every fan who subscribes from an ad **cost us money** to acquire
- If they don't spend, **we LOSE money**
- Your job is to turn every subscriber into a buyer
- A fan who spends $9.99 today could spend $826 in 3 days (Soccerguy0990 did exactly this)
- **There is no such thing as a "lost cause" fan** — only a fan you haven't found the right angle for yet

---
