**Source:** @ninacarlson inbox analysis (Feb 7, 2026)
**Purpose:** Map pre-built bundles, captions, and automation patterns for AI chatbot replication

---

## 1. WELCOME SEQUENCE

### Auto-Welcome (on subscribe)
```
[Image - teaser shot]
"Okay, now that you're here… what made you click on me? 🤭"
```

### Follow-up (personalization)
```
"hii baby, thanks for subbing..what should i call u? :3"
```

### After they respond with name:
```
"aww thats sweet.. what kinda stuff do you usually like seeing on here, [name]?"
```

---

## 2. PRE-BUILT BUNDLES

### Bundle A: "Solo Content" Request
**Trigger:** Fan asks for solo, teasing, showing off
**Price:** $28
**Contents:** 2 photos + multiple videos (10 total items)
**Caption:**
```
"i got you babe 😌💗 this ones all me showing off slow, playing with my body till i couldn't stop teasing myself.. you gotta see how my ass looks in those tiny shorts 😚 what outfit would make you lose it first?"
```

### Bundle B: "Dom/Control" Theme
**Trigger:** Fan mentions control, being dominated, "take control"
**Contents:** 2 videos + 10 total items
**Caption:**
```
"mm you really want me in control huh.. then look at this and tell me if you'd last a second with my ass bouncing like that 👀"
```
**Example trigger:** "I'd want you to start by taking control"

### Bundle C: "Shy/First Time" Angle
**Pre-sell:**
```
"i wanna show you something i was so scared to show before... 🥺 would u let me do that?"
```
**Post-sell:**
```
"u actually unlocked it for me? i wanted to look good for you.. even if i don't really know how to be sexy yet.. does it show that i tried?"
```

---

## 3. POST-PURCHASE FOLLOW-UPS

### Immediate (after they buy):
```
"still thinking about mine? 🥺"
```

### Upsell tease:
```
"how about i show you something even better... something i made today and havent shown anyone yet?"
```

### Crave trigger:
```
"i know you crave seeing some more of me am i right?"
```

---

## 4. OBJECTION HANDLING

### "No budget" / Card declined:
```
"sooo how generous are you planning to be with me once that card's all good again?"
```

### Fan complains about content:
```
"Of course love im sorry to disappoint 🥺"
"ouch.. calm down babe, im not lying.. maybe the pics just look diff on your screen or the lighting m"
```

### Fan says no:
**NEVER say "no worries"** - always counter-offer or tease

---

## 5. TIP SOLICITATION

### Challenge Loop (high-value tactic)
Fan tips → deliver content → tease "it always gets better 👀" → fan challenges → flip it:
```
"only if you prove it to me that you really want it x"
```
Fan escalates with BIGGER tip to "prove himself"

### Direct ask (after engagement):
```
"what kinda tease gets you the most worked up, babe?"
```

---

## 6. PERSONA CONSISTENCY

### The "Shy/New" Character
- "im still kinda new"
- "i dont usually show off like this"
- "i wanted to look good for you"
- "im scared to show"
- Uses 🥺 emoji frequently

### Playful/Teasing
- "these shorts barely cover me at all wanna see"
- "i got too turned on thinking about you"
- "tempting you is my favorite thing"

---

## 7. AUTOMATION SIGNALS

### Likely automated:
- Welcome message on subscribe
- Mass messages ("am i ur dream girl?💗")
- Time-based queue (every ~30 min self-promo)
- S4S shoutouts (every ~2 hours)

### Likely human/chatter:
- Responses to specific fan requests
- Pricing negotiation
- Objection handling
- Personalized upsells

watching every second my tits out, playing with them slow n deep, 
letting u see what no one else gets to this isnt just hot this is the 
one youll be stroking to in your head forever so if youre really 
ready… dont blink. u wont forget it 😈"
```

### Objection handling (fan asks for discount):

## 9. KEY INSIGHTS FOR AUTOMATION

1. **Bundles are 100% pre-built** - same content goes to everyone asking similar things
2. **Captions are templates** - slight variations but core phrases repeat
3. **"Shy" persona is universal** - deflects lies/unfulfilled promises
4. **Never acknowledge complaints** - pivot to selling more
5. **Volume wins** - fans keep buying even after being disappointed
6. **Challenge loop = high tips** - make THEM prove they want it
