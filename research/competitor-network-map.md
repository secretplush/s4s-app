## Tagging Math

- **60 models** in the network
- Each model posts ~1 tag/minute (API automation)
- Each tagged post stays up **5 minutes**
- At any moment: ~5 active promo posts per model visible
- **60 models × 1 tag/min = 60 tags per minute network-wide**
- **In 50 minutes: potentially 50 tags per model receiving**

This matches Stephanie's observation of 50+ tags in 50 minutes.

## Key Insight

The competitor operates **TWO separate networks** under different brands:
- **College Besties** — 24 models
- **My Friends** — 36 models

Both funnel to the same operation. Combined: **60 models**.

This explains the 7x revenue vs Plush. With 60 models cross-promoting vs Plush's single girls group approach, the traffic multiplication is massive.
