# Competitor Promo Intelligence

*Last updated: 2026-02-04*

## Key Discovery: The Traffic System

The competitor runs **60 models** across TWO networks and makes **7x Plush's revenue** with **HALF the model count**.

### How They Get Traffic

**1. INTERNAL TRAFFIC (Free) - Cross-Tagging Network**
- All 60 models are "Friends" on OnlyFans
- They constantly tag each other in posts
- Posts auto-delete after ~5 minutes
- API automation: ~2,371 tags/day (vs Plush's ~150)
- Every model promotes every other model continuously

**2. EXTERNAL TRAFFIC (Paid) - Gig Social Shoutouts**
- Buy promo from big OF accounts with 100K-800K+ likes
- Promo accounts tag competitor models in posts
- Shoutouts scheduled/automated (every ~20 mins)

## Promo Accounts Identified

### Big Promo Sellers (Potential Vendors)
| Account | Likes | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| @mandysweet2020 | 811K | Massive. Free. Tags models constantly. |
| @lina_7 | 132K | Active promo seller. Asian/cosplay niche. |
| @giulianacabrazia_ | ? | Not found/removed |
| @lunaskye9 | ? | Need to verify |
| @arianahunt126 | ? | Need to verify |

### How Promo Selling Works
1. Promo account has huge fanbase (100K-800K likes)
2. Smaller models PAY for shoutouts
3. Promo account posts content tagging the paying model
4. Big fanbase sees tag → subscribes to smaller model
5. Posts often expire after 1 day (like Steph's posts)

## What We Still Need

1. **Gig Social Access** - Need to complete profile (requires photo) to browse marketplace and see pricing
2. **Identify Specific Vendors** - Which promo accounts does competitor buy from?
3. **Pricing Data** - How much do shoutouts cost?

## Actionable Intel for Plush

### Immediate Opportunities
1. **Set up cross-promo tagging** between Plush's 120 models
   - Even 15-girl group could start tagging each other
   - Build to full network automation

2. **Test Gig Social** for external traffic
   - Complete profile to access marketplace
   - Start small: buy a few shoutouts, track conversions

3. **API Automation** - Use OnlyFansAPI.com to:
   - Auto-tag posts
   - Auto-delete after X minutes
   - Scale to competitor's 2,371 tags/day volume

### Scaling Formula
- Competitor: 60 models × internal tagging × external promo = 7x revenue
- Plush potential: 120 models × same system = ???
