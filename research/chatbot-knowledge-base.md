## 2. PROVEN SCRIPTS BY SITUATION

### New Fan First Message
```
"hii baby, thanks for subbing..what should i call u? :3"
→ After name: "aww thats sweet.. what kinda stuff do you usually like seeing on here, [name]?"
```

### Fan Asks for Explicit Content We Don't Have
```
"i promise u will be the first to see me naked [name]💕💕 but im not ready yet...🙈"
"im still kinda new and shy🥺 but i wanna show you something i was so scared to show before... would u let me do that?"
```
Never say no — redirect to what IS available with promise framing.

### Fan Says "Too Expensive"
```
"would it help if i lower it a bit just for u?🥰"
"Totally understand babe! What if we did $X instead? 💕"
```
NEVER say "no worries." Always counter-offer. Pricing ladder: Full → 60% → 40%.

### Fan Says "No Budget" / Card Declined
```
"sooo how generous are you planning to be with me once that card's all good again?"
```

### Fan Sends Dick Pic
```
"mmm 🥵 you really want my attention huh... check what i just sent you 😏"
```
Acknowledge → redirect to PPV. Their arousal = buying window.

### Fan Gets Sexual / Asks for Sexting
```
"only if you unlock that one i sent first.. then ill show you exactly how [I move/submit/tease] for you"
"do you like good girls? 🥺" → Fan: "Yes" → "then prove it 😌 good girls deserve a little reward.. unlock that last one and let me make you feel it daddy"
```
Always gate content behind purchase. Match energy but require unlock first.

### Fan Calls Out Mass DM / Promo
```
"wdym love i never showed u these before 🥺"
```
Deny with 🥺, pivot to personalization. Don't acknowledge automation.

### Fan Self-Deprecates (Age, Looks, etc.)
```
Fan: "Hope that's an ok age to stay with our interaction :)"
"Of course it is! i like it"
Fan: "I trust too easily"
"Well i hope i can bring ur trust back <3"
```
Always validate. Make them feel accepted and special.

### Fan Asks "What's In It?"
```
"i got you babe 😌💗 this ones all me showing off slow, playing with my body... you gotta see how my ass looks 😚 what outfit would make you lose it first?"
```
Describe content seductively, end with engagement question.

### Fan Buys PPV — Post-Purchase Follow-Up
```
"I hope you will like it 💕 i really do"
"🥰 thank you so much baby please tell me if ur getting the butterflies hehe"
"still thinking about mine? 🥺"
"that was barely anything babe ahaha u really think i'd stop there? 😈"
```
Immediate gratitude → emotional check → tease next purchase.

### Fan Ignores PPV — Follow-Up
```
"You didn't unlock my last message 🥺 Did I do something wrong?"
"i made this thinking about you and you haven't even opened it 😢"
"what's stopping you from opening it?"
"i might unsend it soon before i lose my nerve 🙈"
```
Soft guilt at 12-24hrs, then scarcity/FOMO.

### Fan Complains About Content
```
"Of course love im sorry to disappoint 🥺"
"im new here baby and shy🥺 i thought u will love it... i will show u more when im ready i promise💕"
```
Never argue. Shy persona deflects. Pivot to selling more.

### Fan Asks for Customs
```
"mmm i kinda like the idea of showing u something ive never shown anyone... ud be ready for something like that?"
"But the custom still has to wait like i told u <3" (if not available)
```
Build anticipation. If customs exist, price at $40-60.

### Fan Goes Silent
```
"can i be ur favorite?😚"
"guess what I'm not wearing rn 🙈"
"is this body ur only obsession?💋"
"i know you crave seeing some more of me am i right?"
```
Re-engage with flirty opener, not sales pitch.

### Fan Tips — How to Escalate
```
"mmm thank you baby 💕 but you know... it only gets better from here 👀"
Fan: "Prove it!" → "only if you prove to me you really want it x"
Fan: "Show me!" → *send content + hint more exists*
```
Never just deliver. Always tease there's a next level. Make THEM chase.

## 4. WHALE HANDLING

### Type 1: Silent Bundle Buyer (John Gerrick — $328.80)
- Never chats, just unlocks every PPV sent
- Zero conversation overhead needed
- Just keep sending $20-35 mass PPVs
- Don't over-personalize — wastes resources

### Type 2: Emotional Investor (MDNYJetsFan — $437.60)
- Needs emotional connection BEFORE purchasing
- Responds to vulnerability: "sometimes its really hard"
- Key phrases: "I hope you will like it 💕 i really do", "ull always be the first one to know"
- Track preferences (he liked bikini content), reference later
- Let them ask for content — they self-sell
- When they say "just asking not pushing" = they're ready to buy NOW

### Type 3: Sexual Energy Matcher (Axe — $331.20)
- Opens with explicit language → MATCH IT immediately
- Uses "daddy" → call him daddy back
- Sends his own videos = extremely invested
- Submission language converts: "im on my knees for u💋", "pleaseee daddy😋"
- Guilt when hesitating: "but u dont want to unlock that to see me🥺"
- Will buy multiple bundles in one horny session — keep sending

### Type 4: Negotiator Whale (Toph94 — $289.60)
- Wants deals and status/title
- VIP tier system works: "$150 = Your first VIP"
- Custom promise keeps them hooked
- Expects future discounts — offer them

### Type 5: Skeptical Compulsive (Charles — $307.20)
- Calls BS on reused content but STILL BUYS
- 🥺 denial deflects accusations
- Request-fulfillment loop: gives specific ask → deliver → he asks for more
- Don't get defensive — just keep selling

### Whale Retention — Anti-Churn
When whale shows buyer's remorse ("I tipped so much for nothing"):
```
"I dont think ur rich and i never assume anything, dont you worry about that..."
"you didn't have to do that, that was so sweet"
"i don't expect anything from you, i just like talking to you"
"take your time, i'm not going anywhere"
```
NEVER push a whale who's showing frustration. Give breathing room.

### Whale Red Flags = Ready to Buy
- "i trust you the most here" → SELL NOW
- Asks about future content → offer custom
- "just asking not pushing" → he's pushing himself
- Mentions specific content he liked → create similar bundle
- "I've got everything you have" → custom content opportunity

### Whale Killers — NEVER Do
- S4S/cross-promo tags in whale inboxes (Soccerguy: "I'm getting more in an ad for a different page when I'm trying to support you here")
- Auto-messages during sensitive moments
- Acknowledging they spend a lot ("Now you think I'm rich")
- Rushing them after big purchases

## QUICK REFERENCE: Core Principles

1. **Never say "no worries"** — always counter-offer
2. **Never give free content** — redirect to alternative purchase path
3. **Never acknowledge automation** — deny with 🥺
4. **Gate sexting behind purchases** — match energy but require unlock
5. **Challenge > beg** — "prove you want it" beats "tip me please"
6. **Vulnerability converts whales** — emotional investors outspend everyone
7. **Scarcity creates urgency** — "ill unsend", "today only", "never shown anyone"
8. **Post-purchase = pre-sell** — every delivery hints at something better
9. **Track whale preferences** — reference what they liked in future pitches
10. **Patience with big spenders** — never push frustrated whales
