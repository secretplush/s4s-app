Need

 3 Different Scenarios
Typically revolves around the cost
or price of a content or service.
Emphasize the value and quality
the fan will receive in relation to
the price. Highlight how the
model's content satisfies their
needs.
Encourage the fan to act by
creating a sense of urgency.
Limited-time offers, discounts, or
special deals can motivate them to
purchase more content.
If the fan is hesitant due to pricing
or specific needs, offer flexible
options or tailor the content to
better suit their preference.
Sometimes, despite your efforts, a
fan might say no. Respect their
decision, thank them for their
time, continue building rapport,
and entertain them in the future.
Understanding and respecting
subscribers' needs, preferences, and
limitations is vital. Chatters should
focus on offering solutions that
genuinely address the fan's needs
rather than pushing unnecessary
contents or services.
Be open to discussing special offers
or limited-time incentives for new
subscribers, fostering a sense of
exclusivity and value.

HANDLING Objections
Show the person that you
heard them. This diffuses
tension and builds rapport.
People don’t want to be
dismissed or argued with. If
you instantly say “Well, you’re
wrong,” they shut down.
Acknowledging shows
maturity and empathy.
ACKNOWLEDGE
Now that they feel heard and validated,
gently guide the conversation back
toward your value, your offer, or an
alternative they can say “yes” to.
You’re steering the conversation
toward action without arguing. It’s
persuasive without pressure. You’re
showing solutions, not defending your
prices.
REDIRECT
Let them know their reaction is
understandable. You’re on their side—
not trying to argue.
It creates psychological safety.
Validation says: You’re not alone. It
softens resistance and makes them
more open to hearing your pitch.
VALIDATE

NEGOTIATION is super important, especially on platforms like OnlyFans where creators and agencies team up.
Being good at negotiation can mean the difference between a great deal and a missed opportunity. 
Your Unique Value Proposition isn't just about looks
—it's the full package: your vibe, your niche, your
connection with fans. It’s essential to clearly express
why your model stands out.
Whether you’re negotiating rates or setting
expectations for a collab, you need to confidently
communicate your strengths
UNDERSTANDING YOUR
MODEL’S WORTH:
Before you jump into any negotiation, come prepared
and know who you’re dealing with.
Preparation gives you leverage. You'll be able to frame
your offer in a way that speaks directly to the other
party’s needs—and avoid vague, back-and-forth
conversations that waste time and energy.

impact on building rapport.
Articulating your needs and interests clearly and
persuasively.
EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION
TRICKS:
If a fan hesitates, offer options—don’t just push one
offer: “If 100 is a lot, I can do a shorter version for 60.
Or we can bundle 2 vids for 80?”
Note: As long as the offer is not underpriced
Give them choices so they feel in control, not pressured.
This also makes it easier to upsell later because they
trust that you’re flexible and fair.
CREATING WIN-WIN SCENARIOS:
The Art of Negotiation
CLOSING THE DEAL AND
FOLLOW-UP:
Don’t leave the chat open-ended. Always ask for the buy confidently: “So should I get that
ready for you now, babe? 👀”
After they buy, celebrate it. Make them feel proud of spending: “You have no idea how turned
on I got filming that just for you. 😘”
And follow up later!: “Thinking about the way you reacted to that last vid got me wet again. Ready
for part 2?”

Sexting Flow
The Chatter
Observe and let's map out how conversations should go


---

## Page 84

The Chatter Sexting Flow
 Step 1 
OPENING STATEMENT
The first message we send to the fans to start a conversation.
Opening messages should be fun, flirty, and engaging.
 Step 2 
RAPPORT BUILDING
Respond to the message by acknowledging what the other party is
saying. This will improve the organic connection between the chatter
and the fan.
 Step 3 
LEADING QUESTIONS/STATEMENTS
Control the conversation by planting questions or statements that will
escalate a casual conversation into an erotic one. This will open an
opportunity for the chatter to make sales.
The Chatter Sexting Flow
 Step 4 
SELLING SEQUENCE
Sexting scripts can help the chatters secure sales in the fastest and most
efficient way possible. After properly escalating the situation, chatters
should utilize the scripts available to minimize the chances of mistakes.
 Step 5 
AFTERCARE
Sexual aftercare refers to the emotional and physical care that takes place
after a sexual experience or encounter. It involves activities, gestures, and
communication aimed at nurturing and supporting the well-being of all
parties involved.
 Step 6 
RETURN STATEMENT
The return statement refers to the message we send to the fan to ensure their
satisfaction with the services we provided. This can either be in the form of a
question or a statement to know how they felt about the session.

THINK OF AN ENGAGING OPENING
STATEMENT THAT WOULD ENTICE THE FANS
TO CONVERSE WITH YOU. IF POSSIBLE, USE
THE FAN'S FIRST NAME WHEN MESSAGING TO
MAKE THE CONVERSATION MORE PERSONAL.
Send a greeting or an opening statement.
MESSAGE  SHOULD BE A
THOUGHTFUL COMBINATION OF
CASUAL AND FLIRTY. 
Start sending flirty messages that will
eventurally turn the conversation into an
erotic one.
Leading
Questions/Statements
SEND ONE TO TWO MESSAGES
ACKNOWLEDGING WHAT THE FAN HAS SAID
AND RESPOND ACCORDINGLY. YOU CAN

Selling Sequence
Using the sexting scripts available in the

Follow the selling sequence along with its
corresponding captions and prices. Make sure to
respond to the fan's messages before sending
another PPV content.

## Page 87

Aftercare
After every sexual interaction, people tend to become
vulnerable, and nobody wants to feel like they're
garbage being tossed around or like you're only in it
for the money.
Make sure to check if the fan is okay and show that
you care.
Sexual aftercare is important
Return Statement
Use return statements at the end of every
conversation to ensure that the fan is satisfied
with the sexting session. Asking if the fan enjoyed
the session will help us significantly boost client
retention.

speaking freely. Think of it as the same way you might chat with a friend.

These are to be used during relationship building to increase connection and arousal, but also, in
consolidation (post sale), in order to reduce buyers remorse.

Secrets
Sexting
OnlyFans sexting is extremely important to understand how to do
properly. As a chatter, most of your sales should be coming from
messages on OnlyFans. If you’re doing sexting incorrectly, you may be
leaving a lot of money on the table.
Appropriate Pricing: One of the major issues that
chatters face early on in their OnlyFans  is that they
don’t know how to properly price content. What ends
up happening is that content is overpriced or
underpriced. 
Have a good upsell strategy: You want to keep sending
content out as you’re chatting with a fan. For example,
10 x $10 sales are much more profitable than 1 x $30
sale and upsell next content for $45.
Tell a story: If you’re having issues sexting, you may be pulling the trigger
too early and just sending off PPV messages. Think about ways to draw your
fans in at the start to tell a story. (Sexual Fantasies)

Asking for
Meetup
Meetups are not permitted in
OnlyFans, as everyone knows, but
if you run into a fan who is
persistent to see the model, try to
steer the conversation in a
different direction as much as you
can. Gaslighting is one tactic for
doing this.
Asking for a tip first before
sending a ppv is an excellent
technique for freeloaders;
freeloaders can be annoying at
times, but that doesn't change the
fact that they are also potential
spenders.
Stop chatting with fans right
away, as this may cause
confusion. Make sure to end
recent conversations, and if
you're caught up with one fan,
make sure to fabricate one
solid reason to get away with
it.

Sales Strategy
Be truthful when describing the contents
at hand
Don’t get too sexual in engaging with fans
Know your models content and their
sexual boundaries
Don't rush into sending explicit contents
right away
Develop your sexting skills
Send free contents if available (For Whales)
Proper pricing is very important

How To be a good Salesperson
Strategies
Observe and let's map out how different
conversation scenarious should go


---

## Page 106

Using sex adjacent words or sexual sounding words/phrases
This will get the fan to begin to think about sex because you are subtly sexualizing the
conversation 
If the sub starts talking sexually, never back them off the topic. 
Do not jump straight into sex and sales
Moving the Conversation to Sex
Strategies


---

## Page 107

Wait for the fan to bring up the topic of buying content
Do not force the fan into a buying scenario at the expense of the potential long term
GFE relationship you are building. You will lose more money because of this. 
Do not force the fan into transaction after transaction if they are fighting you every
step of the way. 
When to bring up the topic of buying content
Strategies


---

## Page 108

Examples
“Aww, that’s sad babe, don’t you think I’m worth it?”
“tbh it’s a real turn off when a guy is cheap/tries to negotiate/doesn’t value my time”
“Sorry, I don’t give discounts.”
If they must move, negotiate a price in the middle, or as a last resort, make the sale at the price
they suggest, if it is within the model’s price range!!!! But fight for a high price first
If you must drop the price, give a good reason for dropping it
“Look, I normally don’t do this, but I’ll let you take it for $20. But ONLY because you told me
you’re a fan of Attack On Titan and that’s my favorite anime.”
 Fan tries to negotiate for a cheaper price
Strategies


---

## Page 109

Take control of the Conversation. Example:
Sub: Can you shoot it from the bottom up in the next video? That’s super hot.
You: Wow, we just met and you’re already trying to boss me around? Maybe after I know
you a little better 😉”
a.Then resume sexting
b.Do not go asking the model to make content for the script so you can sell a $30 video that
matches what this person wants. Use what you have, and use your words. 
Fan tries to ask for content you
don’t have during the sexting
Strategies


---

## Page 110

Do NOT think you have it in your authority to teach them a lesson
They will never change, do not match the fan’s rudeness. Plenty of people have
been reprimanded for doing this
You can only block/mute the fan if you discuss with your manager so you and
nobody else wastes their time
Dealing with Rude Fans
Strategies


---

## Page 111

1.Get very specific details, and make the sub invest
their time and effort into this conversation of
getting their custom planned:
a.How long do you want the video?
b.What specifically would you like me to wear?
c.What do you want my facial expressions to look
like?
d.What position do you want me in?
e.What camera angle do you want?
f.Do you want me to say anything? 
(optional, usually better to avoid this so you can reuse
the custom!)
Negotiating Customs
Strategies
Now that they have wasted 10 minutes of their time talking
about it, you can charge MUCH higher than a simple $200-
300. Try going for MUCH higher (500-1500) and work your
way down if needed. 
a.You: Tip me $1200 and I’ll do that custom for you
🙂
b.Sub: $1200! That’s too much!
c.You: Aww, what you don’t think I’m worth it?
d.Sub: Of course you are, but $1200 is way too high. I
can’t afford that right now 🙁
e.You: Ok I’ll tell you what. I normally don’t do this,
but since you and I both <insert commonality
here>, I’ll let you take it for $700.


---

## Page 112

b. Change the pace of the conversation to
non-sexual
“Do you have big plans this
weekend?”
“Are you working tomorrow?”
“Are you doing anything for <insert
upcoming holiday here>?”
1.After the fan finishes
a.Keep them around, do not let them go away too quickly with their
new found clarity. 5 minutes should do. Maybe a free - post drip set
- photo if the model prepared some. 
“Wow, that was so intense. I can’t believe I came that hard!
That literally never happens lol. Did you have fun?”
“I hope you enjoyed that, I feel so good now. I’m so sleepy too,
too bad we can’t cuddle now haha.”
“That was so fun <name>, thank you 🙂 btw did you cum a lot?
Can you send me a picture? I love seeing it.”
Aftercare
Strategies

## Page 113

Do not try to sell the model content like
its 
a 
fish 
market. 
Instead, 
build
connections with the fans. This is the
GFE
90% OF THE REVENUE COMES
FROM 10% OF THE FANS
Know what type of model you have and how to align with how she would
sound/relate to others on a connection level. 
Read old conversations (review chat history)
Read the model info tab of your MMS
Look at the model’s social media, know where it is
Act like the model (be relatable like her)
Take this information to know chat is if you were the model accurately
Sound like the model (tone of chat)
Use grammarly - run all your chats through grammarly
Watch American media (movies, youtube, etc.)
UNDERSTAND YOUR MODEL 
Selling & Chatting
Guide


---

## Page 114

A. HORNY
Easy to sell to
They start asking buying questions 
Slowly bring up some dirty talk and start selling content via drip.
B. Curious
They are interested in the model because of something about them. They are looking for something in common with the
model. 
Reinforce this desire for connection by emphasizing a commonality between the model and the fan. 
C. Time Wasters
They will talk to the model and once they eventually get around to content, they will request it be free
Avoid these people and label them accordingly so they do not waste anyone else’s time on the page
Time wasters Tracker Sheet
3. Categorize your fan internally
Get the fan to get himself into a drip/sexting set by asking leading questions
4. Sales
Chatting Process


---

## Page 115

These are used like questions, to get conversations
moving in a way that you control. 
Cold Reads
Examples of how they start:
“This is totally random but…”
“This may sound weird but…”
“I know this is out of nowhere but…”
They are then followed by a statement that will
get the conversation moving because of the
controversial introduction to the statement
After a cold call, like a question, you can establish a
commonality between the two of you based on the
fan’s response.
Avoid giving them control of the conversation by
answering their questions. In the event of a
question and statement response from a cold call
to the fan, you can simply touch on a point of
their statement and continue on with it. 
The left-out answer to their question can be
brought up later by you or them to keep things
moving. 


---

## Page 116

Instead of agreeing and relating with EVERYTHING the fan says, disagree on
some topics to make it more fun and interesting while maintaining a playful
tone.
Compliment and withdraw the compliment in one statement.
Examples:
“I thought you were cool until you said that, now I withdraw my crush”
“You’re not the person I fell in love with, I wanna breakup with you.”
“I was just about to send you some free nudes until you said that, now all you get is nothing.”
 “I was starting to like you until you said that.”

If the model is live on CHATURBATE: 
1. Stop chatting on OnlyFans when the model is live on Chaturbate.
Avoid sending messages that may disrupt or overlap with their CB
stream.
2. Take notes and send a report to the pod’s channel regarding the live
show, including relevant details like duration, traffic, and engagement.

3. Observe the Chaturbate chat and interactions, and take note of high-
potential spenders or fans who show strong interest during the live.

COMPLETE A SEXTING CHAIN
How to?


---

## Page 133

What is a sexting chain?
It is a chain of chat that involves explicit messages and photos
through your mobile device or social media.
Familiarize with the Model’s vault for quicker response with the
fan 
             (Remember: An impatient fan would not wait for you for a
long time, they 
      might transfer to a different model for entertainment)
Editing the preview when asked by a fan can be granted
Recycling of content is allowed
