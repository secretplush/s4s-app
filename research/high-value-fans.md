### Rilez Deep Dive - Devoted Fan Pattern

**Chatter note:** "wants naked content"

**Today's messages (showing devotion):**
- 5:00 am: "Wake up 🙄"
- 5:25 am: "You didn't answer me 🙄"
- 5:53 am: Cross-promo sent (@marniecarter)
- 5:54 am: **"I'm only interested in you"** ← REJECTS THE PROMO
- 6:24 am: "Hiiiii"
- 6:54 am: "🤨"

**Key insight:** This fan TIPS because they want a RELATIONSHIP with the model.
- Cross-promo automation ANNOYS devoted fans
- They want personal attention, not to be redirected
- These are the most monetizable fans - they'll buy custom content

### Chatter Notes = Gold
The chatters are leaving notes like:
- "wants naked content" 
- "he likes to be called daddy"

These notes indicate what the fan wants → what to sell them!
